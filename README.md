# Freeware Advanced Audio Organization (FAAC & FAAD)

Official website and technical documentation platform for **FAAC** (AAC encoder) and **FAAD** (AAC decoder), built with VitePress. Both libraries are licensed under LGPL v2.1+.

---

## Highlights & Features

- **FAAC (Encoder)**: Cleanroom LGPL v2.1+ C11/C99 rewrite free of ISO reference code. Supports AAC-LC and HE-AAC v1 with `-b` Average Bitrate (ABR) rate control.
- **FAAD (Decoder)**: C11 decoder for AAC-LC and HE-AAC v1/v2, with optional multichannel support. Licensed under LGPL v2.1+.
- **Interactive Audio Playground**: Live in-browser FAAC encoding powered by a C library cross-compiled to WebAssembly; input decoding uses browser audio support.
- **Technical Documentation & Listening**: Codec selection guidance, CLI usage guides, C API references, and controlled listening guidance.
- **PagesCMS & Decap Integration**: Native `.pages.yml` configuration for content management and blog updates.

## Recommended Local Development (Docker)

To compile the FAAC encoder into WebAssembly using Emscripten and run the full VitePress site locally:

```bash
# Clone repository with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/FreewareAdvancedAudio/freewareadvancedaudio.github.io.git
cd freewareadvancedaudio.github.io

# Build WASM modules and start local development server in Docker
docker compose up --build
```

Access the development server at `http://localhost:5173` (or `http://localhost:8080`).

---

## Node-Only Development (Docs & Content Editing)

If you are only editing documentation, blog posts, or site layout without modifying C code or compiling WebAssembly:

```bash
# Update submodules if needed
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Install Node dependencies
npm install

# Start VitePress with live reload (also regenerates references when vendor docs change)
npm run docs:dev

# Build static production site
npm run docs:build
```

*Note: WebAssembly build artifacts (`docs/public/wasm/`) are compiled inside Docker and published automatically via GitHub Actions without committing generated binaries to Git.*

## Deploying at a subpath or on a fork

VitePress needs the deployment base path at build time. GitHub Actions reads the site's configured Pages URL with `actions/configure-pages` and passes its base path and origin into the Docker build. This supports both a domain-root site and a project site such as `https://nils.schimmelmann.us/freewareadvancedaudio.github.io/`.

For another host, or to override the Pages settings, set the repository Actions variables `SITE_BASE_PATH` (for example `/freewareadvancedaudio.github.io/`) and `SITE_ORIGIN` (for example `https://nils.schimmelmann.us`). Use `/` for a domain-root deployment. Pull-request builds default to the root path unless overridden.

For local builds:

```bash
SITE_BASE_PATH=/freewareadvancedaudio.github.io/ SITE_ORIGIN=https://nils.schimmelmann.us npm run docs:build
npm run docs:preview
```

For Docker builds, pass the same values with `--build-arg SITE_BASE_PATH=...` and `--build-arg SITE_ORIGIN=...`. CSS, navigation, favicon, and the converter's worker/module URLs follow the configured base. Changing the host's mount path requires a rebuild.

Website copy describes use cases and evaluation methods without publishing benchmark datasets, release-specific rankings, or performance snapshots. Evaluate codecs with audio you own or have permission to use.

The Docker production build smoke-tests the real WASM worker with generated tones in AAC-LC and HE-AAC v1, checks M4A/gapless output, and verifies error handling. To run that check against existing WASM artifacts: `node scripts/test-wasm-converter.cjs docs/public/wasm`. Pass a native FAAC CLI path as a second argument to compare MP4 timing, frame durations, and gapless fields against the frontend. HE-AAC follows the frontend's half-rate container domain, including rounding odd input sample counts.
