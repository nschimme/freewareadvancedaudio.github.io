# Free Online AAC Encoder

Convert audio to M4A (AAC), listen to the result, and download it. Your files stay on your device and are never uploaded.

<WasmConverter />

## How to use it {data-icon="headphones"}

1. Drop in an audio file, or pick **Try a demo song** to load a full-length track.
2. Choose a bitrate. The default is a good starting point; lower it for smaller files.
3. Press **Convert to M4A**, play the result next to the original, and download it.

You can change settings and convert again without decoding the file a second time. The average bitrate includes M4A container overhead, so it can differ slightly from the bitrate you selected.

For a repeatable quality test, follow the [listening guide](/docs/listening) and use a local encoder build with recorded settings.

## Settings {data-icon="sliders"}

Open **More settings** for these. The defaults suit most files.

- **Rate control:** *ABR* aims for an average bitrate. *CBR* holds the bitrate constant. *VBR* sets a quality level and lets the size vary.
- **AAC profile:** *Auto* picks for you. *AAC-LC* plays everywhere. *HE-AAC v1* targets low bitrates but isn't supported by every player.
- **Sample rate:** *Auto* lowers sources above 48 kHz to 48 or 44.1 kHz with ABR or CBR, except with HE-AAC v1. With AAC-LC at low bitrates it also drops 44.1 and 48 kHz sources to 32 kHz. *Keep* uses the input's rate. *Custom* picks a lower rate.

## What the output keeps {data-icon="tags"}

- Gapless playback information, so tracks join without a gap.
- Title, artist, album, track number and cover art, when the source is an M4A file. Other formats don't carry tags in.
- A tag naming the FAAC version and the settings used.

## Browser notes & privacy {data-icon="circle-play"}

- **Private & client-side:** Audio files are processed locally in your browser and never uploaded to any server. There are no fees, accounts, or file size limits.
- **Input formats:** Supported formats depend on your browser's decoder, including WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG, M4A, AAC, and WebM.
- **Sample rate accuracy:** For WAV and FLAC, the page reads the sample rate from the file header (such as 44.1, 48, or 96 kHz) and decodes to 32-bit float, preserving full bit depth. Other formats may be resampled by the browser to its native output rate.
- **Playback:** If your browser does not support in-page playback of HE-AAC streams, download the output M4A file and open it in an external media player.
- Keep your original lossless files.
