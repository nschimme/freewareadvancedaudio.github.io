## More audio. Less overhead. {data-icon="gauge-high"}

### Fast encoding and decoding

<BenchmarkShowcase view="speed" />

FAAC encodes 4.2× faster than FDK-AAC, and FAAD3 decodes 2.4× faster. FAAD3 also ties the top overall MOS.

**Benchmark snapshot · November 8, 2026 · MacBook Pro M1, 32 GB.** Encoder and decoder figures come from the same generated leaderboard. Results depend on the tested builds and hardware. See the [benchmark results and tested versions](/docs/aac-benchmark).

### Build only what you need {data-icon="sliders"}

Every feature is a build option: HE-AAC (SBR), HE-AAC v2 (PS), DAB frames, dynamic range control, and channel count. Switch off what you don't use and the flash cost drops with it. See [Trim the build](/docs/esp32-aac#trim-the-build) for every switch. In the default build, FAAC and FAAD3 together are under a third of the size of FDK-AAC ([whole-library comparison](/docs/aac-benchmark#aac-library-size-faac-and-faad3-vs-fdk-aac)).

<Esp32Showcase view="build" />

## Every AAC profile. Real time. On an ESP32. {data-icon="microchip"}

The same FAAC and FAAD libraries that lead on powerful machines also run in real time on the ESP32-S3 and the original ESP32. Even the original ESP32, without PSRAM, decodes AAC-LC and HE-AAC v1 in real time.

<Esp32Showcase view="home" />

[Read AAC on ESP32](/docs/esp32-aac) for the encoding, decoding, and hardware details.

## Hear FAAC with your own music {data-icon="headphones"}

Try FAAC with familiar tracks and choose the settings that work for you. The browser converter needs no installation or uploads.

[Drop your own music into the converter](/playground), choose a bitrate, and listen. For a closer comparison, the [listening guide](/docs/listening) walks through a controlled test. Your feedback helps us understand what works well and what still needs attention.

For measured quality results, see the [AAC benchmark results](/docs/aac-benchmark). Objective scores complement listening, and results depend on the tested builds and hardware.

## Where FAAC and FAAD are used {data-icon="layer-group"}

From camera firmware to desktop audio tools, these projects integrate FAAC or FAAD:

| Project | Integration |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Thingino](https://github.com/themactep/thingino-firmware/blob/stable/package/faac/faac.mk) | Packages FAAC for open-source firmware for Ingenic IP cameras. |
| GStreamer | Provides [FAAC encoding](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/faac/index.html) and [FAAD2 decoding](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/faad/index.html) elements for multimedia pipelines. |
| [LightNVR](https://lightnvr.com/) | Bundles the [FAAC encoder](https://github.com/opensensor/lightNVR/blob/main/src/video/faac_encoder.c) to transcode camera audio to AAC in its open-source network video recorder. |
| [VLC Media Player](https://github.com/videolan/vlc/blob/master/modules/codec/faad.c) | Includes a FAAD2 decoder integration. |
| [fre:ac](https://github.com/enzo1982/freac/blob/master/Readme) | Uses FAAC and FAAD2 for AAC conversion in its audio converter and CD ripper. |
| [AudioBook Boss](https://audiobookboss.app/) | Uses FAAC and FAAD3 to encode and decode AAC audio in its desktop audiobook manager. |

Available libraries and features depend on each project's version and build. Report reproducible library problems in [FAAC and FAAD issues](https://github.com/FreewareAdvancedAudio/faac/issues), including your library version and settings.

## Quick questions {data-icon="circle-question"}

### How do I install the libraries and tools?

Use a package manager or build from source. The [installation guide](/docs/install) explains the options and why package versions matter.

### Which software license do FAAC and FAAD use?

The FAAC encoder, FAAD3, FAAM and FAAR are LGPL v2.1+. Legacy FAAD2, which many package managers still ship as `faad2`, is GPL v2+. [Which version did I get?](/docs/install#which-version-did-i-get)

### Do AAC patents affect my use?

Patent considerations depend on the AAC profile and jurisdiction. See [patent status by profile](/docs/comparison#patent-status-by-aac-profile).

### How can I help improve quality?

Share the exact encoder version, settings, source sample you have permission to distribute, and what you hear. Our [listening guide](/docs/listening) explains how to make a useful comparison and report.
