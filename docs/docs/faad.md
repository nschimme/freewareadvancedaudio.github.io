# FAAD AAC Decoder and C Library

**FAAD (Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder)** is a C11 AAC decoder library and command-line tool, licensed under **LGPL v2.1 or later**. Use `faad` to convert supported AAC files to PCM audio, or integrate `libfaad` to decode AAC frames inside an application.

## AAC decoding capabilities

FAAD supports **AAC-LC**, **HE-AAC v1**, and **HE-AAC v2 Parametric Stereo** when enabled in the build; it does not support xHE-AAC. The library decodes AAC frames supplied by the application and returns PCM, while the command-line tool handles file conversion, including supported container input. See the [supported streams and build requirements](/docs/libfaad#supported-streams) for details.
